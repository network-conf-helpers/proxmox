# Overview
[This repository](https://github.com/network-conf-helpers/proxmox)
features a set of configuration files to set up the networking services
of a [Proxmox distribution](http://pve.proxmox.com).
Those are inspired by blog articles, wikis, or originally designed
and developed by the
[organization team](https://github.com/orgs/network-conf-helpers/teams/contributors).
It provides guidance for end-to-end working examples of how to setup
the networking services of a Proxmox distribution.

Rather than testing the networking configuration on remote servers, a
[specific Docker image preparation project](https://github.com/network-conf-helpers/docker-images)
produces ready-to-use
[Docker images on Docker Cloud](https://cloud.docker.com/u/netconfhelpers/repository/docker/netconfhelpers/base)
